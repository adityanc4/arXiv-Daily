# ADI Astro Daily

ADI Astro Daily is a web application that displays the latest research papers from arXiv’s Astronomy and Astrophysics categories.  
It provides a clean, minimal interface for browsing daily papers, filtering by date, and directly accessing PDFs.

## Overview

The app connects to the arXiv API to fetch new astronomy papers published each day.  
Users can filter by date, view essential paper details (title, authors, categories), and open PDFs directly from the interface.
During development, **Google AI Studio** was used to assist in generating and optimizing TypeScript code for cleaner structure and improved maintainability.

## Features
